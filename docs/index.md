Scimap is a scalable toolkit for analyzing single-cell multiplex imaging data. The package uses the [anndata](https://anndata.readthedocs.io/en/stable/anndata.AnnData.html) framework making it easy to integrate with other popular single-cell analysis toolkits such as [scanpy](https://scanpy.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#). It includes preprocessing, phenotyping, visualization, clustering, spatial analysis and differential spatial testing. The Python-based implementation efficiently deals with datasets of more than one million cells.
