## Set up

[Install Scimap](../md/install_scimap.md)  
📥 [Download demo data](../md/demo_data_scimap.md)  
📁 Prepare demo data for analysis  

## Cell Phenotyping

    🤹🏼‍♂️ Phenotype cells by unsupervised clustering
    👽 Phenotype cells using a hierarchical probabilistic model
    🙌 Add Regions of Interest (ROIs) for exploration
    🤩 Explore the composition of defined cell types between samples and ROIs

## Spatial Analysis

    📍 Calculate and visualize distances between cell types
    🤏 Cell-cell interaction/ co-occurance analysis
    ⚖️ Compare proximity scores between samples
    🔭 Search for spatial patterns

## Cellular Neighbourhoods

    🌳 Compute neighborhoods using cell-type or cluster information (includes LDA method)
    🚀 Compute neighborhoods using expression data
